# Net.Shared.Queue

## Overview

The Queue Providers Management Library is a .NET library tailored for managing various queue providers like RabbitMQ, among others. It offers common interfaces and methods for efficient queue provider management. This library simplifies the integration and handling of queue events in .NET applications.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Interfaces:** Includes common interfaces for managing queue events, providing a consistent approach across different queue providers.
- **Provider Registration Extensions:** Features extension methods for registering each queue provider, ensuring a seamless and efficient setup process.
- **Flexible Queue Management:** Allows the use of one provider per host, accommodating various queue management scenarios.

## Usage

Ideal for developers working with message queue systems in their .NET applications, this library offers a unified way to handle queue events, enhancing the performance and reliability of messaging systems.

## Core Interfaces

- **`IMqConsumer`** and **`IMqProducer`**: These interfaces define the essential operations for consuming and producing messages in a queue system. Both interfaces include methods like `Consume`, `TryConsume`, `Produce`, and `TryProduce`, which are generic and can be implemented for different message and payload types.

## Integration

1. Integrate the library into your project as a standard .NET library or via Nuget package.
2. Register your queue provider using the specific methods provided by the library.
3. Implement the `IMqConsumer` and `IMqProducer` interfaces in your application to handle queue events.

The library is accompanied by comprehensive documentation, including examples for using the interfaces and methods to manage queue events effectively.
